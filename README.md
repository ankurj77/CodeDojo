81. Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit. For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].

82. Using a read7() method that returns 7 characters from a file, implement readN(n) which reads n characters. For example, given a file with the content “Hello world”, three read7() returns “Hello w”, “orld” and then “”.
